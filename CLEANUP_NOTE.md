# ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Note

## Old Frontend Directory

The old `Frontend/` directory at the root level can be safely deleted once you've confirmed the new structure works.

**New Location:** `src/frontend/`
**Old Location:** `Frontend/` (can be removed)

## How to Remove Old Directory

If you encounter issues removing the old Frontend directory (due to file locks), try:

```bash
# Close any IDEs/editors first, then:
rm -rf Frontend/

# On Windows, you may need to:
# 1. Close VS Code, File Explorer, etc.
# 2. Use PowerShell or Command Prompt
# 3. Or manually delete via File Explorer
```

## Verification

The new structure should work perfectly with:
- `python scripts/start_dev.py`
- `./start.sh`
- `start.bat`

All paths have been updated to use `src/frontend/` instead of `Frontend/`.
